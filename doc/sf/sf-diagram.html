<FONT SIZE=+3><b>Linux Integrity Subsystem</b></FONT>
<p>The goals of the kernel integrity subsystem are to detect if files have
been accidentally or maliciously altered, both remotely and locally,
appraise a file's measurement against a "good" value stored as an extended
attribute, and enforce local file integrity.  These goals are complementary
to Mandatory Access Control(MAC) protections provided by LSM modules, such as
SElinux and Smack, which, depending on policy, can attempt to protect file
integrity. The following modules provide several integrity functions:</p>
<object type="text/html" style="float:right" height=450 data="tcg.html-20100504"></object>
<UL>
<LI><B>Collect</B> - measure a file before it is accessed. </li>
<LI><B>Store</B> - add the measurement to a kernel resident list and, if a
hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is present, extend the IMA PCR </li>
<LI><B>Attest</B> -if present, use the TPM to sign the IMA PCR value, to
allow a remote validation of the measurement list.</li>
<LI><B>Appraise</B> - enforce local validation of a measurement against a
'good' value stored in an extended attribute of the file.</li>
<LI><B>Protect</B> - protect a file's security extended attributes
</UL>
<p>The first three functions were introduced with Integrity Measurement
Architecture (IMA) in 2.6.30.  The EVM/IMA-appraisal patches add support for
the last two features.</p>

<P> IMA measurement, one component of the kernel's integrity subsystem, is part
of an overall Integrity Architecture based on the
<a href="https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/home">Trusted Computing Group's
</a> open standards, including Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Trusted Boot,
Trusted Software Stack (TSS), Trusted Network Connect (TNC), and Platform
Trust Services (PTS). The diagram shows how these standards relate, and
provides links to the respective specifications and open source
implementations. IMA and EVM can still run on platforms without a
hardware TPM, although without the hardware guarantee of compromise
detection.
